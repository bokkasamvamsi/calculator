## 🧮 Simple Calculator – Web Project

This is a basic **calculator web application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app features a responsive and clean UI, simulating a traditional calculator with support for basic arithmetic operations.

### 📌 Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Real-time display update
* Clear/reset functionality
* Stylish and responsive design
* Keyboard-independent (fully clickable)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML**: Structure and layout
* **CSS**: Styling with Flexbox and Grid
* **JavaScript**: Logic for calculation and dynamic DOM updates

### 📁 File Structure

```
calculator/
├── index.html    # Main HTML file
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```
### 🔧 How It Works

* Each button click updates a global `calculation` string.
* The `eval()` function computes the result when `=` is pressed.
* Operators and the clear button are styled distinctly for better UX.
* Button clicks trigger display updates via `updateDisplay()`.

### ⚠️ Note

This calculator uses JavaScript's `eval()` for evaluation. While sufficient for basic use, `eval()` should be avoided in production apps due to security risks. Consider using a math parser library like `math.js` for safer handling.
